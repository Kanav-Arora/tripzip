Welcome to our project! We're glad you're interested in contributing.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Reporting Issues

- Use the GitHub issue tracker to report any issues, bugs, or feature requests.
- Check if the issue has already been reported before creating a new one.
- Provide a clear and descriptive title and include as much information as possible.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your contribution.
2. Follow the coding style and conventions used in the project.
3. Make sure your code is well-commented and easy to understand.
4. Write descriptive commit messages.
5. Make sure to update documentation if your contribution changes existing functionality.

## Testing

We encourage contributors to thoroughly test their code before submitting a pull request. This helps maintain the quality and stability of the project. Please follow these guidelines for testing:

- Provide clear instructions on how to test your changes, including any specific scenarios or edge cases.
- Ensure that your code passes any existing unit tests.
- If applicable, write new unit tests to cover your changes.
- If your contribution affects the user interface, perform manual testing to ensure proper functionality.


## Code Review Process

All contributions go through a review process to ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to project standards. Here's how the code review process works:

1. **Submission**: When you submit a pull request, it will be assigned to one or more reviewers.

2. **Review**: Reviewers will thoroughly examine your code, looking for issues such as bugs, code style violations, and logical errors.

3. **Feedback**: Reviewers will provide feedback on your pull request. This may include suggestions for improvements or requests for clarification.

4. **Iteration**: Make any necessary updates based on the feedback received. This may involve multiple rounds of review and revision.

5. **Approval**: Once the code meets the project's standards and the reviewer is satisfied, your pull request will be approved.

6. **Merge**: After approval, a project maintainer will merge your code into the main branch.

Please be patient during the review process, as it may take some time for reviewers to provide feedback. If your pull request is not accepted, don't be discouraged. Use the feedback to make improvements and resubmit.
